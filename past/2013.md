BayesOpt 2013<br>Bayesian Optimization in Theory and Practice
---------------

There have been many recent advances in the development of machine learning
approaches for active decision making and optimization. These advances have
occurred in seemingly disparate communities, each referring to the problem using
different terminology: Bayesian optimization, experimental design, bandits,
active sensing, automatic algorithm configuration, personalized recommender
systems, etc. Recently, significant progress has been made in improving the
methodologies used to solve high-dimensional problems and applying these
techniques to challenging optimization tasks with limited and noisy feedback.
This progress is particularly apparent in areas that seek to automate machine
learning algorithms and website analytics. Applying these approaches to
increasingly harder problems has also revealed new challenges and opened up many
interesting research directions both in developing theory and in practical
application.

Following on last year's NIPS workshop, "Bayesian Optimization & Decision
Making", the goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners from these diverse subject areas to facilitate cross-fertilization
by discussing challenges, findings, and sharing data. This year we plan to focus
on the intersection of "Theory and Practice". Specifically, we would like to
carefully examine the types of problems where Bayesian optimization performs
well and ask what theoretical guarantees can be made to explain this
performance? Where is the theory lacking? What are the most pressing challenges?
In what way can this empirical performance be used to guide the development of
new theory?


Invited speakers and panelists
-------------------------------

The workshop has confirmed the following invited speakers:

- [Ryan Adams](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rpa/) (Harvard University)

and in addition, along with our speakers we will also host a panel discussion on
"The intersection of theory and practice" as it relates to Bayesian
optimization. Our additional panelists include:
