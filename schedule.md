**Title:** Benchmarking Beyond Branin
**Abstract:** Bayesian optimization has evolved to deal with problems beyond typical black box optimization. Recent approaches handle high dimensional problems, exploit cheap approximations of very costly problems, and optimize across a set of tasks. Tracking progress in this constantly evolving area of research requires thorough empirical evaluations. In this talk I will give an overview of possibilities to assess the performance of our methods, including a new class of surrogate benchmark problems which enable efficient and realistic comparisons.
