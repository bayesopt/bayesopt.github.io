### Frank Hutter

Abstract to come.

### Jeff Schneider -- Bayesian Optimization for Embedded Learning Systems

An important property of embedded learning systems is the ever-changing
environment they create for all algorithms operating in the system.  Optimizing
the performance of those algorithms becomes a perpetual on-line activity rather
than a one-off task.  I will review some recent work on Bayesian optimization in
robotics and scientific applications, focusing on scaling up the dimensionality
and managing multi-fidelity evaluations.  I will finish with some thoughts on
future research directions to support the move of these algorithms into embedded
systems.

### Marc Deisenroth

Abstract to come.

### Matt W. Hoffman -- Information-based methods for Black-box Bayesian Optimization
