Bayesian Optimization in Academia and Industry
----------------------------------------------

Bayesian optimization has emerged as an exciting subfield of machine learning
that is concerned with the global optimization of noisy, black-box functions
using probabilistic methods. Systems implementing Bayesian optimization
techniques have been successfully used to solve difficult problems in a diverse
set of applications. There have been many recent advances in the methodologies
and theory underpinning Bayesian optimization that have extended the framework
to new applications as well as provided greater insights into the behaviour of
these algorithms. Bayesian optimization is now increasingly being used in
industrial settings, providing new and interesting challenges that require new
algorithms and theoretical insights.

At last year's NIPS workshop on Bayesian optimization the focus was on the
intersection of "Theory and Practice". The workshop this year will follow this
trend by again looking at theoretical contributions, but also by focusing on the
practical side of Bayesian optimization in industry. The goal of this workshop
is not only to bring together both practical and theoretical research knowledge
from academia, but also to facilitate cross-fertilization with industry.
Specifically, we would like to carefully examine the types of problems where
Bayesian optimization works well in industrial settings, but also the types of
situations where additional performance is needed. The key questions we will
discuss are: how to scale Bayesian optimization to long time-horizons and many
observations? How to tackle high-dimensional data? How to make Bayesian
optimization work in massive, distributed systems? What kind of structural
assumptions are we able to make? And finally, what can we say about these
questions both empirically and theoretically?

The target audience for this workshop consists of both industrial and academic
practitioners of Bayesian optimization as well as researchers working on
theoretical advances in probabilistic global optimization. To this end we have
invited many industrial users of Bayesian optimization to attend and speak at
the workshop. We expect this exchange of industrial and academic knowledge will
lead to a significant interchange of ideas and a clearer understanding of the
challenges and successes of Bayesian optimization as a whole.

A further goal is to encourage collaboration between the diverse set of
researchers involved in Bayesian optimization. This includes not only
interchange between industrial and academic researchers, but also between the
many different sub-fields of machine learning which make use of Bayesian
optimization. We are also reaching out to the wider global optimization and
Bayesian inference communities for involvement.
