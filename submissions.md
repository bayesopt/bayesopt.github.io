Call for papers
----------------

The *NIPS Workshop on Bayesian Optimization* is calling for contributions on
theoretical models, empirical studies, and applications of Bayesian
optimization. We also welcome challenge papers on possible applications or
datasets. Topics of interest (though not exhaustive) include:

- Bayesian optimization
- Sequential experimental design and bandits
- Applications, e.g., automatic parameter tuning, active sensing, robotics
- Related areas: active learning, reinforcement learning, etc.

See also the [workshop overview](index.html) for more details.


Submission instructions
------------------------

Papers must be in the latest NIPS format, but with a maximum of 4 pages
(excluding references). Papers can be either anonymized or not (i.e. you can
decide whether to uncomment or add `\nipsfinalcopy` to your document prior to
submitting). The reviewing process will be anonymous.

Accepted papers will also be made available on the workshop website. However,
this does not constitute an archival publication and no formal workshop
proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish
their work in archival journals or conference.

Submissions can be made through
[cmt.research.microsoft.com/BO2014](https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/BO2014).


Important dates
----------------

- Submission deadline: October 23rd
- Notification: November 6th
- Camera ready: December 3rd
