## Call for papers

The *NIPS Workshop on Bayesian Optimization* is calling for contributions on
theoretical models, empirical studies, and applications of Bayesian
optimization. We also welcome challenge papers on possible applications or
datasets. Topics of interest (though not exhaustive) include:

- Bayesian optimization
- Sequential experimental design and bandits
- Applications, in industry or academia, other scientific disciplines welcome
- Related areas, e.g., active learning, reinforcement learning

See also the [workshop overview](index.html) for more details.


## Submission instructions

Papers must be in the latest NIPS format, but with a maximum of 4 pages
(excluding references). Papers can be either anonymized or not (i.e. you can
decide whether to uncomment or add `\nipsfinalcopy` to your document prior to
submitting). The reviewing process will be anonymous (i.e., blind).

Accepted papers and eventual supplementary material will also be made available on the workshop website. 
The camera-ready papers have to include the `\nipsfinalcopy`.
However, this does not constitute an archival publication and no formal workshop
proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish
their work in archival journals or conference.

Submissions can be made through

[cmt.research.microsoft.com/BAYESOPT2017/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2FBAYESOPT2017).
