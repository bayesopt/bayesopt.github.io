Contain all the files of the http://bayesopt.github.io website.

The accepted papers are stored in the "paper" folder in a subfolder based on the year,

Each year, the workshop from the last year should be archive in the "past" folder by creating a single "yearnumber.md" file that include all the relevant information (e.g., call for the workshop, speakers, organizers, accepted papers, committee, dates, schedule of the workshop).
